|====================
|Feature |Oracle |PostgreSQL

|Tablespace
|Exists as a logical object and made from one or more user-specified or system-generated data files.
|Logical object that is tied to a specific directory on the disk where datafiles will be created.

|Data file
|Can be explicitly created and resized by the user. Oracle-Managed-Files (OMF) allow for automatically created data files.

Each data file can contain one or more tables and/or indexes.

|Behavior is more akin to Oracle Managed Files (OMF).

Created automatically in the directory assigned to the tablespace.

Single data file stores information for a specific table or index. Multiple data files can exist for a table or index.

Additional files are created:

Freespace map file Exists in addition to the datafiles themselves. The free space map is stored as a file named with the filen- ode number plus the _fsm suffix.

Visibility Map File Stored with the _vm suffix and used to track which pages are known to have no dead tuples.\

|Creates a new tablespace with system-managed data files
|CREATE TABLESPACE sales_tbs DATAFILE SIZE 400M;
|create tablespace sales_tbs LOCATION '/postgresql/data';

|Create a new tablespace with user-managed data files
|CREATE TABLESPACE sales_tbs DATAFILE '/oradata/sales01.dbf' SIZE 1M AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 1M;
|N/A

|Alter the size of a datafile
|ALTER DATABASE DATAFILE '/oradata/sales01.dbf' RESIZE 100M;
|N/A

|Add a datafile to an existing tablespace
|ALTER TABLESPACE sales_tbs ADD DATAFILE '/oradata/sales02.dbf' SIZE 10M;
|N/A

|Per-database tablespace
|Supported as part of the Oracle 12c Multi Tenant architecture. Different dedicated tablespaces can be created for different pluggable databases and set as the default tablespace for a PDB:
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER =
'sales';

CREATE TABLESPACE sales_tbs DATAFILE '/oradata/sales01.dbf' SIZE 1M AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 1M;

ALTER DATABASE sales TABLESPACE sales_tds;
|Tablespaces are shared across all databases but a default tablespace can be cre- ated and configured for the database:

create tablespace sales_tbs LOCATION '/postgresql/data';

CREATE DATABASE sales OWNER
sales_app TABLESPACE sales_tbs;

|Metadata tables
|Data Dictionary tables are stored in the SYSTEM tablespace.
|System Catalog tables are stored in the pg_ global tablespace

|Tablespace data encryption
|Supported

Supported using transparent data encryption.

Encryption and decryption are handled seamlessly. Users do not have to modify the application to access the data.
